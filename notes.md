##ToDo

  * Adjust sorting such that it can happen by arbitrary spans within a line
    * such that one could implement... start sorting when dark pixel is found, end when light is found
    * or start sorting at x_s pixel, end sorting at x_e

  * Make gif of the sorting process happening, because that stuff is cool af

  * Play with brightness calculation
