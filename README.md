## TheDennenning / CS_Art / Rewrite

In this branch lives code implementing the generation of abstract works of art created with rewrite systems.

It can create gifs of rewrite systems generating towers of transformations

It can create stills of finished towers too!

Compilation options are in Makefile, examples are given in the /Examples/ directory. 

Enjoy, and if you have any questions, please email me and ask! (Chris.Denning00 at gmail.com)
