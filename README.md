## TheDennenning / CS_Art

# Painterly

In this branch lives code implementing the generation of impressionistic works of art given an image.

It can create stills of an image, by creating lists of strokes from the image and plotting them at random. Currently, the strokes are only circular, though eventually I will be working with creating different kinds of strokes, curved, textured, and otherwise.

It can also animate the creation of stills, which, when done with multiple photos in series, creates a sort of impressionistic animation. 

Compilation options are in Makefile, examples are given in the /Examples/ directory. 

Enjoy, and if you have any questions, please email me and ask! (Chris.Denning00 at gmail.com)
