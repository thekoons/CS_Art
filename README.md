## TheDennenning / CS_Art / Cellular

In this branch lives code implementing the generation of abstract works of art created with cellular automata.

It can create gifs of cellular automata, supporting arbitrary parameterization of both two- and three-state automata, with arbitrary changes to parameterization by frame. 

It can also output stills (as .bmp images) along the way.

Compilation options are in Makefile, examples are given in the /Examples/ directory. 

Enjoy, and if you have any questions, please email me and ask! (Chris.Denning00 at gmail.com)
