## TheDennenning / CS_Art / Physics

In this branch lives code implementing the generation of abstract works of art given various physics simulations.

Currently, the physics simulation supported is a mess of variously sized circles, given various positions and velocities, whose intersections are then tracked and plotted. 

Compilation options are in Makefile, examples are given in the /Examples/ directory. 

Enjoy, and if you have any questions, please email me and ask! (Chris.Denning00 at gmail.com)
