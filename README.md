CellAutoAnimation
=================

This library implements an animation program designed to create gifs of cellular automata.

ToDo:

	Create MVP
		DONE - Rewrite bitmap to create bitmaps of white and black squares
		DONE - Create Cellular library to create successive bitmap frames using cellular automata rules
		DONE - Integrate these to gif.h to create gifs
	
	Make Better
		Implement scripted rule-changing
		Implement windows with different rules
		Implement color
		Implement the addition of other images
		Implement pixellation filters

	Make Best
		Implement auto-generation from music
		Implement MLA to identify shapes within which the Cellular Automatas can be generated
